## what is this?

a chaotic, expressive little tool for making blinkies, 88x31 buttons, microbanners, and pixel tags — no photoshop, no code.  
made for neocities, webrings, cyber shrines, forums, zines, and indie homepages across the new old web.

you can:
- generate custom text
- pick fonts, backgrounds, borders, glitter overlays
- export blinkies and buttons instantly
- remix the tool to suit your own subculture or project

built entirely in html, css, and js — zero backend. host it anywhere, modify it freely.
